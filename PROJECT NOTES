#shebang, lets the ruby interpreter what environment you want to run. telling it what it's going to be running.
"we want to use the ruby interpreter in order to run this file"

Basic for pushing to Github - push OFTEN.
1. git pull
2. git push

1. Plan gem, imagine interface 
2. Google some premade gems for project structure
3. Start with entry point - the file run
4. Force that to build the interface
5. Stub out the interface
6. Start coding things
7. Discover Objects
8. Program

Separation of Concerns
1. Scraper Class - Scrapes the raw data from NBA.com
2. Player Class - Creates Instances of each player (name, url, description, bio)
3. CLI - Controller

2 Levels Deep
- First Level: List of 50 greatest NBA Players
- Second Level: The individual player page + summary of career


Basic Interface:

def run
   HomepageScraper.scrape_players - Scrapes the data, loads everything up 
   
   welcome #-> welcome the user, accepts an input to get to the next level of the menu
      #if input == "start" -> self.list_players
      #else -> puts "I'm sorry, I thought you wanted to learn something today!"

   # choose_player # -> accepts an index,  
      # -> sets local variable of player, then uses the index to pick the player's position in the Player.all array 
      # scrapes the player's bio, loads it up
      # calls self.display_player_info(player)



Finishing Touches
- The event loop - DONE
- Need to incorporate Shaq 
- Paginate the players 
- require gem that formats the return outputs  [https://github.com/ruby-formatter/rufo]


   
   
   def print_players(from_input)
      puts ""
      puts "---------- NBA Legends #{from_input} - #{from_input+9} ----------"
      puts ""
      Player.all[from_input-1, 10].each.with_index(from_input) do |player, index|
        puts "#{index}. #{player.name}"
      end
